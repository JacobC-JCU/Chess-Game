Project: Chess Game

This Python program is a chess game, which I developed as part of my studies at the University of South Bohemia. 
It is a two-player game; unfortunately, there is no single-player mode. The game was inspired by Wizard's Chess from the Harry Potter series.

Special thanks for the support from my teacher, who guided me through this project and helped me solve issues I couldn't figure out

Enjoy the game!

Best regards,
Jacob
