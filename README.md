Project Chess Game

This Python program is a chess game that I developed as part of my studies at the University of South Bohemia.
It is a two-player game; unfortunately, there is no single-player mode yet (maybe in the future). The game was inspired by Wizardâ€™s Chess from the Harry Potter series.

Special thanks to my teacher for guiding me through this project and helping me solve issues I couldn't figure out.

Enjoy the game!

Best regards,
Jacob
